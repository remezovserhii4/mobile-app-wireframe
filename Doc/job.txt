Looking for someone that can put together an interactive prototype using the limitless admin HTML5 bootstrap template. Using our basic wireframe mockup and user flow, we need a developer to build the navigation structure and then build some of the pages by just copying the standard elements to each page, no new styling or functionality. I have attached the basic wireframe mockup and the link to the admin template. We've purchased the template.
